description: '<p>It''s too hot! Come cool off with a cold coffee, and join us for
  some afternoon networking. Bring your questions, laptops, and enthusiasm!</p> <p>Around
  the start of the event, we''ll do intros, then break out to do whatever we''d like.
  This will be an informal event overall, so no worries if you can''t make it right
  at 1:00.</p> <p>We''re headed back to Gravel &amp; Grind this month. It''s been
  a really great location for us, and I always love coming back here. We may move
  to FITCI in the future as our cohort grows, but this is a good fit for us right
  now.</p> '

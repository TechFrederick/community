description: '<p>Happy New Year! Come join us for some afternoon networking. Bring
  your questions, laptops, and enthusiasm!</p> <p>Around the start of the event, we''ll
  do intros, then break out to do whatever we''d like. This will be an informal event
  overall, so no worries if you can''t make it right at 1:00.</p> <p>We''re headed
  back to Gravel &amp; Grind this month. It''s been a really great location for us,
  and I always love coming back here. We may move to FITCI in the future as our cohort
  grows, but this is a good fit for us right now.</p> '

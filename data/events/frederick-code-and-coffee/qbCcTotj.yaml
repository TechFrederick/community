description: '<p>I''m late! I''m late! Come join us for some afternoon networking.
  Bring your questions, laptops, and enthusiasm!</p> <p>Around the start of the event,
  we''ll do intros, then break out to do whatever we''d like. This will be an informal
  event overall, so no worries if you can''t make it right at 1:00.</p> <p>We''re
  headed back to Gravel &amp; Grind this month. It''s been a really great location
  for us, and I always love coming back here. We may move to FITCI in the future as
  our cohort grows, but this is a good fit for us right now.</p> '

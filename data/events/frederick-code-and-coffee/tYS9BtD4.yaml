description: '<p>Happy February!</p> <p>.....</p> <p>The host is out of the country
  this month. However, as part of a larger push towards getting all of the local tech
  meetups on a consistent schedule, we''re scheduling this meet-up anyway. It''ll
  be at the usual place and time. We''re also looking for a co-host that''s interested
  in taking on hosting duties if there are other times the host can''t make it.</p>
  <p>.....</p> <p>Come join us for some afternoon networking. Bring your questions,
  laptops, and enthusiasm!</p> <p>Around the start of the event, we''ll do intros,
  then break out to do whatever we''d like. This will be an informal event overall,
  so no worries if you can''t make it right at 2:00.</p> <p>We''re headed to Gravel
  &amp; Grind this month. I''m always on the lookout for a local, comfortable place,
  that''s accessible and easy to find. This place really fits the bill. I look forward
  to seeing you all there!</p> '

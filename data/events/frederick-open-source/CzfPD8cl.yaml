description: '<p>We''re bringing back FOS chill out events! The chill out events are
  our low key way of getting to know other tech people in Frederick. We talk tech,
  get to know each other, and do a bit of feedback to figure out what kinds of sessions
  to have in the future.</p> <p>This chill out will be a casual dinner at Black Hog
  BBQ. In the spirit of 4th of July week, what''s more American than some BBQ!? Come
  join in for a good meal and a good chat.</p> '

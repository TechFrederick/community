description: "<p>CI/CD is a set of practices used by engineering organizations to\
  \ improve the quality of software they deliver, how fast they deliver that software,\
  \ and detect issues with that software before they affect end users. Unfortunately,\
  \ the term can mean a lot of different ideas and approaches. So, in this talk we\u2019\
  re going to try to unravel some of those ideas to give you some ideas on how you\
  \ too can deliver software better. I\u2019ll also give you some links to some tooling\
  \ so you can see how it\u2019s done.</p> "

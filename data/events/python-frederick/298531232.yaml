description: "<p>In this talk we\u2019re going to start from nothing and build out\
  \ our own tools for making art in Python, no AI needed! We\u2019ll show how Python\u2019\
  s expressiveness allows us to describe graphics elegantly and use that to make some\
  \ unique art programmatically.</p> <p>Also, we're going to have another \"after\
  \ hour.\" After the presentation is over, anyone who wants to stay and do a bit\
  \ of coding or chatting is welcome to hang out. Think of it like a mini open workshop.</p> "

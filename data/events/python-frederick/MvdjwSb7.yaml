description: '<p>\*Original Meeting date was April 10 but moved due to scheduling
  with the speaker.\*</p> <p>Is your data locked up in portable document format (PDFs)?
  In this talk we''re going to explore methods to extract text and other data from
  PDFs using readily-available, open-source Python tools (such as pypdf), as well
  as techniques such as OCR (optical character recognition) and table extraction.
  We will also discuss the philosophy of text extraction as a whole.</p> <p>Also,
  we''re going to have another "after hour." After the presentation is over, anyone
  who wants to stay and do a bit of coding or chatting is welcome to hang out. Think
  of it like a mini open workshop.</p> '

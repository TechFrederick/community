  In 2016, the organizers of [Frederick Web Tech](/groups/frederick-web-tech/),
  [AWS Frederick](/groups/aws-frederick/),
  [Frederick Open Source](/groups/frederick-open-source/) (which was called KeyLUG at the time),
  [Frederick Startup Community](https://www.meetup.com/Frederick-Startup-Community/),
  and [Python Frederick](/groups/python-frederick/)
  decided
  that Frederick should host hackathons.
  These organizers believed that hackathons would help foster a community culture
  around technical innovation.
  Since hackathons are a popular event format to attract technical people of all skill levels,
  the group sought to build a stronger community
  and pull them together for a shared event.
  The group pulled together the event with the help of One for All Events,
  an event hosting company owned by Eli White, the organizer of Frederick Web Tech at the time.

  On October 8th, 2016, the group organized and ran a hackathon event at [Hood College](https://www.hood.edu/).
  The hackathon partnered with Nexmo, JetBrains, and other software vendors to support
  roughly 50 people in attendance ranging from high schoolers to retired professionals
  and everyone in between.

  The format for this hackathon was a tutorial.
  Attendees learned about how to use Python to piece together data
  from the OpenWeatherMap API to send weather reports directly as SMS messages
  to their phone.
  This was not a groundbreaking use of technology,
  but the tutorial helped the attendees grow their understanding of how web APIs work.

  While the old Jekyll site is no longer functioning
  to show the pretty version of the website,
  you can still view all the project code and instructions
  on the [hackfrederick GitHub repository](https://github.com/hackfrederick/hackathon2016).

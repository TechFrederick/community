description: '<p>\*The previous talk, PDF Text Extraction, has been postponed until
  the August meeting date due to scheduling issues with the presenter.\*</p> <p>In
  this talk we''ll walk through the basics of Scrapy, a web crawling framework, to
  extract data from publicly accessible internet sources.</p> <p>Also, we''re going
  to have another "after hour." After the presentation is over, anyone who wants to
  stay and do a bit of coding or chatting is welcome to hang out. Think of it like
  a mini open workshop.</p> '

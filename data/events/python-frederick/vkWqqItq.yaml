description: '<p>In this session, we will explore how to use Python to enhance your
  AI projects with:</p> <p>* **Click CLI**: Creating command-line interfaces.<br/>*
  **Jinja2 Templating**: Generating dynamic content.<br/>* **GPT Libraries (gpt4all
  / OpenAI)**: Integrating language models.</p> <p>We''ll walk through a project that
  shows these tools in action. By the end of the session, you''ll have the skills
  to create a functional AI application that uses these technologies for real-world
  tasks. Join us to see practical demonstrations and get hands-on experience. Connect
  with other Python developers and expand your AI toolkit.</p> <p>Also, we''re going
  to have another "after hour." After the presentation is over, anyone who wants to
  stay and do a bit of coding or chatting is welcome to hang out. Think of it like
  a mini open workshop.</p> '

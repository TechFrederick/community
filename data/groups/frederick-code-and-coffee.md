Who is this meetup group for?

🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **We’re a Community.** We strive to have our attendees feel like they’re a part of the group. This group is not run by a company - it is run by a group of individual community members. This branch of Code & Coffee specifically is run by one person who wanted to reach out and network with some locals.

📈🔍 **Of Software Developers,** new and old. Or for people who work with them or want to become one.

🐣🐓 **At Any Level.** Whether you’re aspiring, newer, or more experienced. From seasoned staff engineers to people that just completed their first Hello World, we want you to come out and be a part of our group.

We're a part of the larger Code & Coffee community. Come learn more about us here and see what we're all about.

💬 **Discussion.** Many attendees come with questions, ideas, or strategies to discuss.<br>
🕸 **Networking.** Many people come to meet people; that's enough reason on its own.<br>
**Support.** Many of our attendees in the past have also found mentors, mentees, and peer support. We encourage it!

**How are we planning to expand?**<br>
**Engage with speakers.** We're looking for people who are interested in sharing their skills, knowledge, and even projects.<br>
**Sponsorship.** We're actively looking for a local sponsor to host this event. Please reach out if you're interested!<br>

We are an open community but do not tolerate bad behavior. We're LGBTQIA+ operated and a safe space for people that need it. Our community centers around three principles: Belonging, Safety, and Trust.

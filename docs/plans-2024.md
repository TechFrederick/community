# Plans

How do we improve networking within our community?

* TechFrederick is working on this.
* Automate portions of event publishing to increase connections.
* Improve the consistency of the calendar and get regular events going.

Regular Meetups

We would like meetup events to run on a regular cadence,
here are the days in each month that the groups run on.

| Day in month | Meetup group |
| ---- | ---- |
| 1st Tuesday | FOS |
| 2nd Wednesday | Python Frederick |
| 2nd Saturday | WordPress |
| 3rd Thursday | AWS Frederick |
| 3rd Saturday | Open Workshop |
| 4th Wednesday | WebTech |
| 4th Sunday | Code and Coffee |

* Semi-regular social event in the evening at Frederick Social for Code and Coffee

Re-engage Game Dev? Can they get going as a regular group?

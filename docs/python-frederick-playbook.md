# Python Frederick Playbook

This page documents the operations of the Python Frederick meetup.
The Python Frederick organizers can use the activities provided here
to divide roles and responsibilities
to ensure that Python Frederick functions well.

## Ongoing Activities

* Each new member receives a direct chat for the organizer.
  This chat is an opportunity to open a discussion with the new member
  and answer any questions that they may have about the group.
  The goal is to help the new member feel connected and recognized
  to foster a strong community.
  The content of the message (signed by Matt in this example) is shown below.
  These messages are sent at the beginning and middle of the month
  so that the message is never too far from when the member joined.
* Periodic messages to the announcement mailing list
  at python-frederick-announce@messages.meetup.com
  that notify about upcoming events.
  * A reminder email about all upcoming Python Frederick and other local meetup events
  * A set of short reminders about the event for the month
    on `Wednesday - 1 week before event`
    and `Monday before Wednesday event`.

```
Hi there!

I want to personally welcome you to Python Frederick! I like to send a note to every new person who joins the meetup. Python Frederickâ€™s goal is to help people in our local community learn more about the Python programming language and be a friendly space for all people who are interested in programming, including you.

If you've got any questions for me, please let me know. You can also join the TechFrederick Discord to chat with other local tech people at https://discord.gg/YFKZ9dt66J

Regards,
Matt
Python Frederick organizer

## Event Planning

Python Frederick hosts three primary kinds of events:

1. Presentation Nights
2. Social Dinners
3. Open Workshops

### Presentation Nights

The presentation night format runs on 2nd Wednesday of each even month. That is:

* February
* April
* June
* August
* October
* December

The goal of this meetup type is to give attendees the opportunity to learn about Python
in some technical context.
There is no set format for this event and the topics vary wildly,
but we do try to make certain that there is some connection
to the Python programming language.
The event cover things like:

* Direct updates about upcoming features in the language
* Explorations of some popular packages in the language ecosystem
* Applications of the language in interesting projects
  (e.g., using Python to track airplanes passing overhead)
* More general topics where Python may only be partially related
  (e.g., security threat modeling where some Python-based tools are used)

Pre-event:

* Find topic and speaker. Since the event dates are well-known in advance,
  coordination on this is not too difficult.
  In the past, a call for speakers often produces people who can speak,
  but speakers have been sourced from other places like checking other local area meetups
  in Virginia and contacting speakers directly via Meetup chat.
* Once the topic and speaker is found, we need:
  * Topic name -
    This is set as `The Topic Name (2nd Wed Talk)` on the Meetup event.
    `(2nd Wed Talk)` is added to emphasize the regularity and cadence of the event type.
  * Topic description -
    We ask the speaker to provide an overview of the topic that we can share.
    Sometimes speakers aren't great at writing this in an enticing way,
    so some editing may be needed.
    Topic descriptions are appended with the paragraph below to show that there is more
    than the presentation only.
  * Presenter name and biography -
    Including the presenter's name and a brief biography helps to humanize the event.
* Secure venue. This should be a non-issue in the future with upcoming availability
  of the FITCI community space.
  There will likely be some signup process with FITCI to confirm the venue
  in the future.
* Create event on Meetup.
  * Always on a 2nd Wednesday
  * Start time at 7pm ET
  * Duration of 2 hours
  * Set venue
  * (You can check previous Meetup event settings or ask on Discord if anything is unclear.)
* At least two weeks before the event, the event needs to be "announced" on Meetup.
  When the event is announced through the Meetup UI, a message about the upcoming event
  will be sent to all members.
* Additional announcement emails are sent to the list at the cadence listed
  in the "Ongoing activities" section. These additional emails are
  *the most effective way to improve engagement and attendance*.
  People forget about events and the extra reminders are useful to pull in people
  who might have forgotten about the event.

```
Also, we're going to have another "after hour." After the presentation is over, anyone who wants to stay and do a bit of coding or chatting is welcome to hang out. Think of it like a mini open workshop.
```

During event:

The event organizer acts as the emcee at the event.
The things to do are:

* Arrive 15-30 minutes before the official start time.
  Some folks are regularly early, and it stinks if there is no one there to greet them.
* Arrange the space to be open and welcoming.
  Remove distant rows of seating if possible.
  Some developers will be deliberately antisocial if possible
  (even though this is a social event by design!).
  Removing seating that is far from the presenter brings people closer together
  and eases the speaking strain on the presenter.
* Set up the AV equipment. This will need more information once we get into the new FITCI space.
* Set up recording equipment if available.
  We aren't some event recording business, so the recording aren't very high tech,
  but having some video recording (of the screen at least)
  and an audio feed is something that can be shared with members who couldn't attend
  that evening.
* Help speaker get their gear connected.
* Start the event 5-10 minutes after the official start time to give people a chance
  to come in.
* Do announcements.
  * Thank sponsors:
    PSF (Python Software Foundation) for covering Meetup cost
    and FITCI (Frederick tech incubator) for hosting space.
  * Mention other meetups and their upcoming events.
  * Mention the Discord to get people connected.
    (Future state: mention `community.techfrederick.org` as a path to get people info).
* Do icebreaker.
  * The group is usually of a size that we can share each others names
    and answer a fun question.
    This often has the effect of improving the conversations and discussion
    with the presenter later.
* Invite speaker up and start recording.
* Enjoy presentation.
* Generally, do Q&A after the presentation is over.
* Thank the presenter (and clap).
* Remind people about the next event, thank them for coming.
* Let people know the event is over, but that they don't have to leave right away.
  Pack up and shut down AV stuff while people wind down.
* (Future option: is there a food place / bar that we could migrate to after the event?
  It would be cool to mingle a bit, maybe 15-20 minutes,
  then go somewhere close and interesting to continue socializing.)

Post-event:

* Work with Matt to get event recording uploaded to YouTube
  and added to the Python Frederick playlist.
* Send final email thanking attendees, linking to video recording on YouTube,
  and listing the other upcoming events.

### Social Dinners

The social dinner format runs on 2nd Wednesday of each odd month. That is:

* January
* March
* May
* July
* September
* November

The goal of this meetup type is to give the community a chance to connect and chat.
The presentation night is great, but it doesn't have nearly as much opportunity
to form relationships. The dinner format is solely intended to encourage people
to get to know each other.

We try to mix up the types of cuisine to appeal to all different palettes.
Past restaurants are tracked on
[Python Frederick dinners](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zsE5nwDQHbCO8_PCdhCeH3tqcoAJ_iTdwEo-W8feTog/edit#gid=0).

The restaurants are generally selected by participants on the TechFrederick Discord.
Because we want to avoid making large reservations
since the amount of attendees can fluctuate wildly,
our only constraint is that we try to pick places with good amounts of seating
and availability.

Pre-event:

* Select a restaurant via discussion in Discord.
* Create event on Meetup.
* Try to stick to the 7pm start time, but confirm that the restaurant is open
  for 2 hours from the start time and adjust accordingly.
* Include some kind of image from the restaurant.
  We want the events on Meetup to be appealing visually.
* At least two weeks before the event, the event needs to be "announced" on Meetup.
  When the event is announced through the Meetup UI, a message about the upcoming event
  will be sent to all members.
* Additional announcement emails are sent to the list at the cadence listed
  in the "Ongoing activities" section. These additional emails are
  *the most effective way to improve engagement and attendance*.
  People forget about events and the extra reminders are useful to pull in people
  who might have forgotten about the event.

During event:

* Hopefully, no pre-planning or reservation is required.
* Enjoy the meal.
* Thank the attendees.
* Let them know about ways to get connected (like the Discord).
  For many attendees, this will be there first event.
  If we don't try to connect them to other things, it may be their only event.
  Try to make a good first impression.

Post-event:

* Send final email thanking attendees and list the other upcoming events.

### Open Workshops

This event is a recurring event that is done in partnership
with the other local meetups.
Before modifying the event, consult with the other organizers
in #meetup-organizers on Discord.

Pre-event:

* At least two weeks before the event, the event needs to be "announced" on Meetup.
  When the event is announced through the Meetup UI, a message about the upcoming event
  will be sent to all members.

During event:

* Let attendees know about ways to get connected (like the Discord).
  For many attendees, this will be there first event.
  If we don't try to connect them to other things, it may be their only event.
  Try to make a good first impression.

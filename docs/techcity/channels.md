# Channels

Channels are where techcity can send outbound information to other services
like Discord or X.
This page documents the available channels and how to configure the channel
within `techcity.toml`.

## Console

This basic channel is designed to output broadcast information to the terminal output.
The channel is meant mostly for debugging purposes.

## Discord

TODO: Create and document the Discord broadcasting channel.

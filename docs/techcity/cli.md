# Command Line Interface

The techcity command line interface (CLI) is a way to trigger actions
within the techcity platform.
The CLI acts as a client and works by sending command events
to interested services.

The current CLI operates in-process,
but is designed so that a future iteration could operate
over a network boundary.

See [Events](events.md) for all relevant command events.

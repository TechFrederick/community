# Connectors

The techcity platform supports multiple connectors to fetch data from external
data sources. This page describes each of the available connectors.

## Meetup Connector

The Meetup connector will detect any Meetup group by looking for the `meetup`
extension data in the group configuration. For each Meetup group, the connector
will use the Meetup API to pull event data and publish information
about physical events.
